Because his heart was beating irregularly, doctors suspected he had atrial fibrillation, the most common type of arrhythmia, which can increase the risk of stroke. But to decide how to treat him, they needed to know exactly how long his heart had been acting up.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e310b76a2e24f386a9f3c3a61b315b20/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=624&cropwidth=1200&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F4e7c2137ca15977fb188a032265cc6aa5dfc153d.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>
